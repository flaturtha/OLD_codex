# Codex .. BookTracker

tracking updates & changes:

11/24/15 - FINALLY(!) got the subdoc update syntax figured out. Next step is to add in the Spot Illustrations.

11/23/15 - all but illustrations set in BookView to allow editing. A form input is created on double-click, allowing update. Works on all fields except illustrations, due to issues with the subdocument values.
